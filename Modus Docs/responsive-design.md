# Responsive Design

Our web components are built with responsiveness in mind, providing flexibility and adaptability across various screen sizes and devices. This document outlines our approach and how you can leverage these features in your projects.

## Key Features

1. **Fluid Typography**: Components use a fluid typography system that scales smoothly between minimum and maximum font sizes based on viewport width.

2. **Responsive Layouts**: We utilize CSS Flexbox and Grid for inherently responsive layouts.

3. **Breakpoint-based Adjustments**: Components adjust their styles at predefined breakpoints for optimal display across devices.

4. **Customizable Styling**: CSS Custom Properties (variables) allow easy theming and customization.

5. **Size Variations**: Many components offer size options (e.g., small, medium, large) for further control.

6. **Full-width Options**: Where applicable, components can expand to full width for improved mobile experiences.

## Usage for Consumers

### Basic Implementation

Adjust component size based on screen size.

```html
<modus-wc-button label="Click me" size="medium"></modus-wc-button>
```

### Apply Full-width on Mobile

Use media queries to apply full-width on smaller screens.

```html
<style>
  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    modus-wc-button {
      --modus-wc-button-width: 100%;
    }
  }
</style>
<modus-wc-button label="Full-width on mobile"></modus-wc-button>
```

### Custom Styling

Override default styles using CSS Custom Properties.

```html
<style>
  modus-wc-button {
    --modus-wc-button-padding: 1em 2em;
    --modus-wc-button-font-size: clamp(14px, 2vw, 18px);
  }
</style>
```

### Responsive Containers

Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to create responsive layouts with our components.

```html
<style>
  .button-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
    gap: 1rem;
  }
</style>
<div class="button-container">
  <modus-wc-button label="Button 1"></modus-wc-button>
  <modus-wc-button label="Button 2"></modus-wc-button>
  <modus-wc-button label="Button 3"></modus-wc-button>
</div>
```

By leveraging these features and techniques, you can create highly responsive designs using our web components, ensuring a consistent and adaptable user experience across all devices.
